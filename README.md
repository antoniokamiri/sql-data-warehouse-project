# sql-data-warehouse-project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server

In this project, I’ve learned how to design and set up a SQL Data Warehouse, a central repository for organizing and analyzing large amounts of structured data. I explored the architecture of a data warehouse, which typically includes a staging area, ETL process, and a structured data layer with fact tables (for quantitative data) and dimension tables (for descriptive attributes). The purpose is to enable complex queries and reporting for business analysis.

I also gained hands-on experience with the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, which involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it to fit the warehouse schema, and loading it into the data warehouse. This process is crucial for maintaining data consistency, quality, and usability for reporting tools like Power BI or Tableau.

Additionally, I learned about performance optimization techniques for data warehouses, such as indexing and partitioning large datasets for faster query execution. Regular data validation and auditing are also vital to ensure data integrity. Through this project, I’ve developed a deeper understanding of how to efficiently manage large datasets and provide actionable insights through SQL queries and reporting tools.
